echo # 🎙️ Voice-Encoding
echo.
echo This project is part of the **StreamLingo VoiceSync** initiative and focuses on extracting speaker-specific voice embeddings from audio files using pretrained models. The goal is to analyze, visualize, and cluster voice features that are essential for real-time voice preservation and translation systems.
echo.
echo ## 📌 Project Objective
echo.
echo To extract speaker embeddings from audio using pretrained models, reduce dimensionality using UMAP, and visualize clustering using KMeans and HDBSCAN. This helps understand how unique each speaker's voice is and supports downstream personalization tasks.
echo.
echo ## 🧠 Models Used
echo.
echo ^| Model     ^| Dimensionality ^| Source      ^|
echo ^|-----------^|----------------^|-------------^|
echo ^| wav2vec2  ^| 768            ^| Facebook AI ^|
echo ^| OpenL3    ^| 512            ^| MIT CSAIL   ^|
echo ^| VGGish    ^| 128            ^| Google      ^|
echo.
echo These models generate fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) capturing timbre, tone, accent, and speaker characteristics.
echo.
echo ## 🛠 Features Implemented
echo.
echo - ✅ Load embeddings for selected model (wav2vec2, OpenL3, VGGish)
echo - ✅ UMAP projection of embeddings into 2D space
echo - ✅ Clustering using:
echo   - KMeans (k=2)
echo   - HDBSCAN (density-based clustering)
echo - ✅ UMAP scatter plots with cluster coloring
echo - ✅ File-to-cluster mapping table
echo - ✅ Interactive Streamlit frontend for model selection and visual output
